        <h2>The Background Behind The ATM</h2>

            The ATM wasn't always around, it allows bank customers to deposit or withdraw money without going to the bank. 
            “Banks initially resisted ATMs. They feared high costs and technical issues. 
            Many believed customers preferred human tellers. Over time, attitudes changed as benefits became clear." 
        </p>

        <p>
            Before the Automated Teller Machine, tellers were the only way to make a transaction to the bank.

            It wasn't until 1939, when Luther Simjian applied for 20 patents related to his 
            ATM invention and field tested his ATM machine in what is now Citicorp. 
            After six months, the bank reported that there was little demand for the new invention 
            and discontinued its use.”

            It was reintroduced in 1967 by John Shepherd-Barron, a Scottish inventor and was installed at a branch of Barclays Bank in Enfield, London.
            The ATM was initially a cash dispenser that used special vouchers with a secret code number using carbon 14 and was a success that was copied by other banks.

        <p>
            However, carbon 14 was not the best choice for the ATM as it was slightly radioactive,
            so the ATM was redesigned to use plastic cards with magnetic strips and more festures were added 
            such as depositing checks and transferring money,.

        <p>
            Eventually, the magnetic strip could be breached and was replaced with the chip and pin system which was more secure and finally the contactless system with a nfc chip.

            Computer science is used to set up the software of the ATM. 
Mechanical Engineering creates the inner working in the ATM to make the conveyer that prints money. 
Electrical Engineering sets up the cords and power source. 
Computer engineering connects the screen, cords,  
­ “­An ATM is simply a data terminal with two input and four output devices. Like any other data terminal, the ATM has to connect to, and communicate through, a host processor. The host processor is analogous to an Internet service provider (ISP) in that it is the gateway through which all the various ATM networks become available to the cardholder (the person wanting the cash).” 
Data terminals, host processors and internet service providers make ATM’s work.

            Nowadays people can even make transactions online with an app to check their balance, and even deposit checks.
            The ATM has come a long way from its humble beginnings and has become a staple in the banking industry.
